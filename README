My first real try with Scala

This is a web parser for Registro Publico de Panama to look for companies registered (useful for any newspaper).

At a glance:
-Using Akka 2.0 in Master/Worker classs
-Pimp My Library in JSoupExtensions
-Cake Pattern, which I'm not sure is the correct implementation, for the Storage trait
-jSoup for HTML parsing
-Have a trait for either ScalaJ or Dispatch. Using ScalaJ because Dispatch requires to set the correct charset
-MongoDB for storage
-Java wrapper for creting runnable jar

Take note that this is not using SBT , which I tried but is failing to work properly. 

You will need these libraries
-Akka 2.0
-Casbah commons, core and query
-Commons logging
-Dispatch core and http
-Http Client and Core (Dispatch dependencies)
-Joda Time (MongoDB dependency)
-jSoup
-MongoDB 2.7.3 and Driver
-ScalaJ collection and http
-SF4LJ (MongoDB dependency)
